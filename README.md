- The purpose of this code is to create a pencil drawing using Processing.

I originally made a regular pencil with straight forward instructions (which I saved the
code on a separate file if needed) since my original algorithm was too detailed. So I
followed my second algorithm on that code, but since the Professor asked for us to impress her,
I decided to take the next step.

I have researched various tools and functions to make the pencil 3D. That includes,
P3D, for loops, light(), directLight(), translate(), shadows, etc. Everything I implemented
did not give the effect I wanted (except by shadow, I couldn't find this function. I dont know
if it exists). I would like to learn more about 3D and light effects. I also
did not want to make this code too long and complicated (I am known for that). I decided to
play with the colors instead. This design will be built in a 8-bit color "scheme" style (not
really 8-bit).

This tutorial uses the following functions:

 size, background, noStroke, fill, ellipse, rect, triangle, smooth.

 Code structure:

 - variables for colors
 - setup
   - screen size
   - smoothing the edges
   - removing shapes' border
 - draw
   - background color
   - Eraser
   - Eraser Holder / Ferrule
   - Pencil Body
   - Wood tip
   - Lead
